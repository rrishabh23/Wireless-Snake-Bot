# Wireless-Snake-Bot

The snake contains 6 segments actuated by servo motors and joined with metal brackets. The servos are controlled by an Arduino Mega and
powered by a LiPo battery. It uses NodeMCU(ESP8266) for wireless control.
An Android device is used to control the bot with the use of this [app](/SnakeBot Control.apk)
